- https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/scsi.html: Small Computer Systems Interface. SCSI commands can be transported over just about any kind of bus, and are the default protocol for storage devices attached to USB, SATA, SAS, Fibre Channel, FireWire, and ATAPI devices. SCSI packets are also commonly exchanged over Infiniband, TCP/IP (iSCSI), even Parallel ports.
