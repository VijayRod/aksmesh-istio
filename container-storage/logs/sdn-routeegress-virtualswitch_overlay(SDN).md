## overlay
- https://collabnix.github.io/kubelabs/ClusterNetworking101/: Overlay network refers to the virtual network layer (SDN). In this type, you’ll hear terms like veth (virtual eth or virtual network interface), and VxLAN. It is designed to be highly scalable than the underlying network. For example, while VLANs in the underlying network support only 4096 identifiers, VxLAN can reach up to 16 million ones.
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/sdn/manage/understanding-usage-of-virtual-networks-and-vlans: You can create overlay virtual networks, also called Virtual Networks, with Hyper-V Network Virtualization.
  - When you deploy Hyper-V Network Virtualization, overlay networks are created by encapsulating the original tenant virtual machine's Layer-2 Ethernet frame with an overlay - or tunnel - header (for example, VXLAN or NVGRE) and Layer-3 IP and Layer-2 Ethernet headers from the underlay (or physical) network.
- https://support.tools/post/kubernetes-networking-deep-dive/: An overlay network in Kubernetes is a virtual network that spans multiple nodes in a cluster and provides connectivity between Pods running on different nodes. The overlay network is built on top of the physical network infrastructure and enables the communication between Pods, regardless of their physical location in the cluster.
  - In Kubernetes, network plugins are used to implement the overlay network. Network plugins are responsible for setting up the virtual network, encapsulating and transmitting traffic between Pods on different nodes, and routing traffic to external services.

## overlay.underlay
- https://collabnix.github.io/kubelabs/ClusterNetworking101/: Underlay network is closer to the physical layer or you can say that, the network without SDN capabilities. It includes switches, routers, VLANs and so on. It is the basis on which overlay networks are built. It tends to be less scalable due to technical limitations. However, since it’s closer to the actual hardware, it is slightly faster than an overlay.
