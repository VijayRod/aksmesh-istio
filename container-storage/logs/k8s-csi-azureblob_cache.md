- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-csi-blob-storage-provision?tabs=mount-nfs%2Csecret#before-you-begin: About blobfuse cache: By default, the blobfuse cache is located in the /mnt directory. If the VM SKU provides a temporary disk, the /mnt directory is mounted on the temporary disk. However, if the VM SKU does not provide a temporary disk, the /mnt directory is mounted on the OS disk, you could set --tmp-path= mount option to specify a different cache directory
