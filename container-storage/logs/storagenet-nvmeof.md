- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction: Azure Container Storage mounts persistent volumes over network block storage protocols (NVMe-oF or iSCSI), offering fast attach and detach of persistent volumes. using NVMe-oF over TCP.
- https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/tip/Choosing-your-storage-networking-protocol: Built on the NVMe specification, NVMe-oF is a high-speed storage protocol for accessing solid-state storage across network fabrics such Ethernet, Fibre Channel and InfiniBand. 90% of the NVMe-oF protocol is the same as basic NVMe, which was designed for SSDs that connect directly to a computer through a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express bus. Like NVMe, NVMe-oF can take better advantage of a flash drive's inherent speeds, which are often limited by more traditional protocols and interfaces.
