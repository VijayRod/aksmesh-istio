# aksmesh-istio
This is my personal page dedicated to AKS with the Istio-based service mesh, and any opinions expressed here are my own. The commonly used tools for this project are [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), kubectl, and optionally [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/), or you can use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart?tabs=azurecli). For a quick start guide, refer [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli).
